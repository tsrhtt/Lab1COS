### Digital Signal Processing
# Laboratory Work â„–1: Generation of Analog Signal

### Purpose of the Work
To study the methods of generating an analog signal using the built-in digital-to-analog converter of the STM32 microcontroller.

### Notes
To complete the work, an STM32 microcontroller and the corresponding software for its programming are required. The report should include signal diagrams, graphs, and the results of the program execution.
